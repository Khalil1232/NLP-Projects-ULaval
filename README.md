# NLP-Projects-ULaval

### Work 1 :
The purpose of this work is to become acquainted with text analysis and the challenges it entails, 
This project enabled us to manipulate regular expressions initially, N-gram models subsequently, and classification models for the purposes of information extraction, prediction, and text categorization. 

- Task 1: Regular Expressions
- Task 2: N-gram Language Model
- Task 3: Text classification - Sentiment Analysis
- Task 4: Text classification - Language Identification

All of this is implemented in Python 3.9.7, primarily using the NLTK, re, Scikit-learn, and Spacy libraries. 

### Work 2 :

The goal of this work was to utilize pretrained word embeddings, training a feedforward model (MLP) initially and training a recurrent model (LSTM) subsequently, all while using PyTorch.

- Task 1 : Question Classification - Feedforward Network (MLP) and Word Embeddings
- Task 2 : Complete the proverb using an LSTM network and Spacy embeddings.


### Final Project :

#### Speech to text : Conversion des courts audios (Ã  un mot) en texte
